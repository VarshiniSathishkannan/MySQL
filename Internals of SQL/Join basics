null,null

Full join:

Inner join + all the other records from left and right

Above 8 + 3 (left) + 2 (right)

Cross join:

For every record in left table, it matches with every record in right table irrespective of the value, no join condition

count(Tb1) * count(Tb2)

Natural Join:

It is similar to cross join if there is no matching column, if there is a matching/same column name, then it behaves like a inner join 

no join condition here as well
