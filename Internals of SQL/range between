What is RANGE BETWEEN?
RANGE BETWEEN defines a window frame based on the values of the ORDER BY column, not row positions like ROWS BETWEEN.

So instead of saying ‚Äú2 rows before and after,‚Äù you're saying ‚Äúvalues within a certain range.‚Äù

Key Concept:
It works on the values of the ORDER BY column.

Best used with numeric or date/time columns.

May not behave as expected with non-unique ORDER BY values.

Is RANGE BETWEEN supported in MySQL?
‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî but only in a very basic form.

üîí What is supported:
RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW

RANGE BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING


SELECT 
  sales_date,
  sales,
  SUM(sales) OVER (
    ORDER BY sales_date
    RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS running_total
FROM sales_data;
This gives you a running total based on sales_date, and it works because it's just UNBOUNDED PRECEDING to CURRENT ROW.

SELECT 
  region,
  sales_date,
  amount,
  SUM(amount) OVER (
    PARTITION BY region
    ORDER BY sales_date
    RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS running_total
FROM sales_data;
